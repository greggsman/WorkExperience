Actual completion:  In a nutshell, the Marshall all-valve, 4-channel JVM410C 100-Watt, 2x12&quot; combo is the most versatile Marshall amplifier ever made. It also boasts more Gain than any other Marshall to date - and that's really saying something!! Each of its 4-channels - Clean, Crunch, OD1 &amp; OD2 - are not only completely independent of each other, they all boast three Modes, all 12 of which are footswitchable and feature their own unique gain structure. It makes the JVM 4-channel effectively 12 Marshalls in one! The JVM410C has built-in, studio-quality digital reverb with a level control for each channel. This is also footswitchable, as are the amp's two Master Volume controls and the Series/Parallel effects loop. Resonance and Presence are equipped with master controls. Even though the head and combo both house 28 controls and 8 LED switches on their front panels, they're incredibly simple to understand because of the extremely logical layout. Each of the 4 channels has the usual suspects when it comes to controls - Volume, Bass, Middle, Treble &amp; Gain - accounting for 20 of the 28 controls right away. Take away the 4 reverb controls and you're only left with 4 Master controls - 2 master volumes plus Resonance and Presence. Add to this an ingenious footswitch (UK patent pending) and the fact all the amp's switching (channel/modes, Reverb, Master Volume selection, FX loop) can be done via MIDI and you're looking at an incredibly flexible amp! The 6-way footswitch boasts 7 LEDs and memory, plus it connects to the amp via a regular guitar cable. From the cleanest clean to the filthiest distortion ever found in a Marshall and all points in-between, the JVM410C all-valve combo amp will give you whatever tone you need right when you need it.| Marshall's new flagship combo features 100-Watts of all tube power into two 12&quot; speakers, (one Celestion Vintage and one a Celestion Heritage), 4 independent channels, 12 footswitch modes, studio quality digital reverb and 2 effects loops The new 6-way, totally programable footswitch gives you MIDI control of all switches to give you complete command of the legendary Marshall tone!
