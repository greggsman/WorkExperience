Actual completion:  GAS DEADWEIGHT TESTER, 100 KPA, W/ PUMP|P3012-KPA-P - Air Deadweight Tester, Single PCU (Pressure Range 1.5 to 100 kPa), With PUMP P3000 Series Pneumatic Deadweight Testers The P3000 Series is the culmination of over 50 years experience in the production and design of primary pressure standards. With features designed to improve accuracy and performance, increase reliability and simplify operation these deadweight testers can be used to calibrate virtually any pressure sensing device, including transducers, transmitters, gauges or pressure switches. Each instrument is supplied with a detachable lid that makes it neat, compact and easily portable. The masses are stored in a high-quality case with a self-locking mechanism to protect them during transit. All units are provided with an accredited calibration certificate, M14X1.5, M20X1.5, 1/8, 1/4, 3/8, and 1/2 NPT and BSP female adaptors, operating fluid (where applicable) and spare seals. The piston/cylinder assemblies are manufactured to the very highest standards and are supplied with accredited calibration reports with stated instrumental measurement uncertainties. P3000 Series Vacuum and Dual Vacuum/Pressure Models The combined vacuum/pressure models are extremely versatile instruments providing vacuum through 500 psi (3.5 MPa) capacity in one unit. An optional built-in hand pump can be installed to generate vacuum (90 %) through 300 psi (2 MPa). P3000 Series Liquid Lubricated Gas Operated Models The Models P3031 and P3032 feature an oil lubricated piston/cylinder assembly, which ensures that the instrument is less susceptible to performance issues caused by contamination of the gas supply or the environment in which the unit is being operated. The supply gas, via the deadweight tester controls, is introduced into the piston/cylinder chamber. As the gas acts directly on the surface of the oil, there is a rate-less transfer of pressure within the system
